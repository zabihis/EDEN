# EDEN
Source code and details about implementation and datasets for EDEN framework

## (I) Datasets
Used datasets can be downloaded from two sources:
- from github: https://github.com/zabihis/EDEN/tree/main/datasets
- from gdrive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSXJfwGpDSJ59ry9KAp8SugQLK35V83f/view?usp=sharing.

** NOTE: To ensure the reproducibility of the evaluation results, please set the "seqLenLimit" parameter for each dataset according to the following table:

| dataset_name     | seqLenLimit
| ------------ | :------------: |
| human_prom_core | 70 |
| human_prom_300 | 300 |
| human_tf0-4 | 100 | 
| mouse_tf0-4 | 100 | 



## (II) Trained models
